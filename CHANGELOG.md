## [4.0.1-mac.1] - 2026-08-25

- Integrated upstream Omarchy 4.0.1 while preserving the Apple Silicon install,
  update, boot, and package safety gates.

  architecture-neutral repairs and holding package swaps outside the validated
  Apple package bundle.

## [4.0.0-mac.16] - 2026-08-24

- Early-loads the Apple keyboard and multi-touch HID drivers to prevent an
  intermittent boot race that could leave the internal trackpad unavailable.

## [4.0.0-mac.13] - 2026-08-24

  ensure existing installations receive the ABI-compatible binary.
