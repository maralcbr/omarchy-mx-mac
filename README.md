# Omarchy for Apple Silicon Macs

Run Omarchy on Apple Silicon through Arch Linux ARM and Asahi Linux.

Omarchy 4 (Quattro) is the maintained release:

| Version | Status | Installation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Omarchy `4.0.0-mac.8` | Recommended stable version | Direct signed installation on Asahi Arch Minimal |
| Omarchy `3.8.4-mac.4` | Legacy | Existing installations can update to Omarchy 4 |

> [!NOTE]
> Omarchy Mac has been tested on M1, M2, and M3 Macs. The complete signed
> release, update, and reboot regression is run on a 14-inch 2021 MacBook Pro
> with M1 Pro (`apple,j314s`). Apple Silicon support still depends on the
> upstream Asahi Linux support available for each model.

## Before You Begin

- Back up macOS and important Linux data.
- Review the [Asahi Linux device support](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/#device-support)
  for your Mac.
- Keep at least 50 GB free on the internal SSD; 100 GB is recommended.
- Use AC power and a reliable Internet connection during installation.
- Expect model-specific limitations around external displays, speakers,
  cameras, power management, or other hardware.

This project is not intended for Parallels, virtual machines, or non-Asahi ARM
systems.

## Fork Features

Omarchy MX Mac keeps Omarchy's desktop experience while adapting installation,
hardware integration, and updates for Apple Silicon:

- Bootstrap from a fresh Asahi Arch Minimal installation into a complete
  Omarchy desktop and regular user account.
- Native Arch Linux ARM and Asahi stack with `linux-asahi`, Asahi firmware,
  regional ARM mirrors, and the dedicated Asahi package repository.
- Hardware-accelerated Apple GPU graphics through the Mesa `vulkan-asahi`
  driver.
- MacBook keyboard-backlight controls, Apple SMC lid handling, display
  brightness integration, and low-battery notifications.
- Widevine support for DRM-protected browser streaming when the package is
  available from the configured Asahi repositories.
- Optional Steam installation through the Asahi ARM64/FEX compatibility
  environment.
- ARM64-native application paths and the Omarchy Quickshell desktop.
- Asahi-aware updates that track `linux-asahi` changes and offer a reboot when
  a new kernel is installed.

Hardware support still depends on Asahi Linux. Omarchy Mac has been tested on
M1, M2, and M3 systems; external displays, speakers, cameras, suspend, and
power management can vary by model.

## Mac Screenshot Shortcuts

The fork adds familiar number-row screenshot shortcuts with `Control` included
so Omarchy's existing `Command+Shift+3/4/5` workspace controls remain intact.
On Apple keyboards, the Command key is Hyprland's `SUPER` modifier.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Control+Shift+Command+3` | Capture the focused display |
| `Control+Shift+Command+4` | Select a region or click a window to capture it |
| `Control+Shift+Command+5` | Open screenshot and screen-recording controls |

The existing Print Screen shortcuts and all Omarchy workspace bindings remain
available.

## Install Omarchy 4

The signed installer takes a prepared Asahi Arch Minimal system directly to
Omarchy 4. It verifies immutable release metadata and never installs moving
`main` or an intermediate Omarchy 3 release.

### 1. Install Asahi Arch Minimal

From macOS Terminal, run the Asahi Alarm installer:

```bash
curl https://asahi-alarm.org/installer-bootstrap.sh | sh
```

Follow the installer prompts and select **Asahi Arch Minimal**. Allocate enough
space for Linux, finish the installation, and boot into the new Arch system.

### 2. Prepare Arch Linux

Sign in as `root` using the credentials provided by the Asahi installer. If
networking is not active, connect through NetworkManager:

```bash
nmtui
```

Update the system and install the release verification tools:

```bash
pacman -Syu --needed curl gnupg linux-asahi-headers networkmanager iwd
```

### 3. Install The Latest Stable Mac Release

Download and run the installer script. It will automatically download the
stable release and verify all cryptographic signatures:

```bash
curl -fLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/main/install-omarchy-mx-mac.sh
bash install-omarchy-mx-mac.sh
```

The signed installer will:

- Verify the stable channel, release descriptor, exact six-package manifest,
  checksums, signatures, architecture, and source identity before mutation
- Install the complete Apple Silicon package set without replacing
  `linux-asahi`, GRUB, or the Arch Linux ARM and Asahi repositories
- Install final Omarchy 4 directly, with no intermediate Omarchy 3 release
- Create the regular Omarchy user and run the Quattro system and user setup
- Build packages unavailable from Asahi repositories from the package-source
  commit pinned by the signed release
- Configure NetworkManager with iwd while preserving the Asahi boot stack

Enter the requested username and passwords carefully. Do not interrupt package
transactions.

### 4. Reboot Into Omarchy 4

After the installer completes successfully:

```bash
reboot
```

Confirm that the display, keyboard, touchpad, Wi-Fi, audio, brightness, and
power controls work. Future releases are delivered through `omarchy update`.

### Stable Support Boundary

The complete automated release regression runs on:

| Component | Validated configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Model | MacBook Pro 14-inch, 2021 |
| SoC | Apple M1 Pro |
| Device tree | `apple,j314s` |
| Architecture | `aarch64` |
| Kernel | `linux-asahi` |
| Bootloader | GRUB |
| Wi-Fi backend | NetworkManager with iwd |

Validation includes a real six-package installation and reboot, package
integrity and protected-file checks, Wi-Fi, DNS, audio, microphone, camera,
brightness, power profiles, and desktop screenshots. M1, M2, and M3 Macs have
also been tested, with model-specific capabilities determined by Asahi Linux.

### Final Verification

```bash
uname -r
pacman -Q linux-asahi omarchy-dev omarchy-settings-dev networkmanager iwd
NetworkManager --print-config | grep 'wifi.backend=iwd'
nmcli device status
omarchy-migrate --pending
cat /usr/share/omarchy/version
```

## Troubleshooting

### Network Is Unavailable

Inspect NetworkManager without assuming a fixed interface name:

```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli device wifi list
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager -b
```

### An Installation Or Upgrade Failed

- Do not reboot during or after a failed package transaction.
- Preserve the complete terminal output.
- Check `/var/log/pacman.log` and the backup path printed by the installer.
- Open a verified bug report with hardware and package information.

## Releases And Support

- [Latest stable release](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/releases/latest)
- [Latest signed Quattro channel](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-pkgs/releases/tag/asahi-quattro-channel)
- [Issues](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/issues)
- [Discussions](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/discussions)

When requesting support, include:

```bash
uname -a
cat /proc/device-tree/model 2>/dev/null
tr '\0' '\n' </proc/device-tree/compatible 2>/dev/null
pacman-conf --repo-list
```

Never post passwords, Wi-Fi credentials, private keys, or complete connection
profiles.

## Repository Name

The repository was renamed from `maralcbr/omarchy-mac` to
`maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac`. GitHub redirects legacy repository and Git URLs, and
a compatibility shim preserves the old GitHub Pages `boot.sh` URL.

Legacy installations can update their remote explicitly:

```bash
git -C ~/.local/share/omarchy remote set-url origin \
  https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac.git
```
