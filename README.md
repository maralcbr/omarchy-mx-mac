# Omarchy Mac — Dual Boot Installation
A concise, beginner-friendly guide to install Omarchy Mac (Asahi Alarm + Omarchy) alongside macOS on Apple Silicon (M1/M2).

_This project is not optimized for Parallels or VMs_

## Project status

This repository is a maintained fork of the original Omarchy Mac work by Malik NA. The goal of this fork is to keep Omarchy Mac aligned with official Omarchy releases while preserving Apple Silicon and Asahi Alarm support.

Mac releases use their own tag namespace, such as `v3.8.2-mac.5`, to avoid conflicts with official Omarchy tags.

## Before you begin

Ensure the following before starting:

- A recent backup of macOS (Time Machine or similar).
- An Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2 family). Verify compatibility: https://asahilinux.org/fedora/#device-support
- At least 50 GB free on the internal SSD (100 GB recommended).
- Internet access.

Checklist

- [ ] Backup completed
- [ ] Sufficient disk space
- [ ] Internet connected

## Quick start

Run the Asahi Alarm installer from macOS Terminal and follow the UI.

```bash
curl https://asahi-alarm.org/installer-bootstrap.sh | sh
```

Select `Asahi Arch Minimal`. When the installer finishes and you boot into Arch, continue with the detailed instructions below.

---

## Detailed installation

Follow these steps after the installer has finished and you have booted into the new Arch system.

### Run Asahi Alarm

- From macOS Terminal run the quick start command above.
- In the installer choose `Asahi Arch Minimal` and allocate at least 50 GB for Linux.

### Initial Arch setup

Run these commands (replace placeholders where indicated):

```bash

#Login as root with username and password 'root'

# Configure Wi‑Fi (if required)
nmtui

# Update packages
pacman -Syu

# Install essential packages
pacman -S --needed git base-devel chromium # nvim, btop, etc.
```

Notes

- If `nmtui` shows an error after activation, reboot and try again.
- Use `--needed` to avoid reinstalling packages that already exist.

### Enable the UTF-8 locale

Edit `/etc/locale.gen`:

```bash
nano /etc/locale.gen # nano, nvim (if installed before), vi, or any other text editor
```

In the opened configuration file scroll and uncomment the en_US line, like this:

```bash
...
#en_SG_SG.UTF-8 UTF-8
#en_SG ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
#en_US ISO-8859-1
#en_ZA.UTF-8 UTF-8
...
```

Save the edited file and proceed to enable UTF-8:

```bash
# To generate new locale.conf
locale-gen

# To apply changes
reboot

locale # Must be UTF-8
```

### Create a regular user

Create a non‑root user and enable sudo for the wheel group:

```bash
# Replace <username> with your chosen name
useradd -m -G wheel <username>
passwd <username>

# Enable wheel in sudoers
EDITOR=nano visudo
# Uncomment: %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Switch to your user
su - <username>
```

Unattended installs: you may use `NOPASSWD:` for wheel, but this reduces security.

### Install yay and Omarchy Mac

As the non‑root user:

```bash
# Install yay (AUR helper)
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si

# Clone and run Omarchy Mac installer
git clone https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mac.git ~/.local/share/omarchy
cd ~/.local/share/omarchy
bash install.sh
```

- Enter your password when prompted and follow the installer's prompts.
- If mirrors fail, run `bash fix-mirrors.sh` from the repository root and retry.

---

## Post-install tasks

- Reboot and select the Linux entry.
- Verify display, keyboard, touchpad, Wi‑Fi, and external monitor support.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### I lost network during install

1. Try the interactive UI: `nmtui`.
2. If that fails, use NetworkManager CLI:

```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli device wifi list ifname wlan0
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID_NAME" password "PASSWORD" ifname wlan0
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager -b
```

Replace `wlan0` with your wireless device name. Inspect `sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager -b` and `/var/log/pacman.log` for clues.

### Mirrors are slow or failing

1. Run the helper: `bash fix-mirrors.sh` and retry.
2. Manually edit `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` if needed:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
# move mirrors from your country to the top
```

3. If regional mirrors are unreliable, use a US fallback (move to top):

```
Server = https://mirrors.kernel.org/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
```

4. Refresh and update:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

Choosing a US mirror is a practical fallback when local mirrors are unreliable.

## Removal (uninstall)

There is no automatic uninstaller. Manual removal requires reversing the install steps. If you need help, open an issue. For a step‑by‑step visual walkthrough see:
